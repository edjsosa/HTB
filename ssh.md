# SSH

SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using public-key authentication using an SSH public/private key pair.

An SSH connection is typically much more stable than a reverse shell connection and can often be used to enumerate and attack other hosts in the network, transfer tools, set up persistence, etc.
